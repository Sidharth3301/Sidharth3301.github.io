Hello there! I am currently pursuing a Masters degree in Visual Computing at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/). I am broadly interested in applications of geometric learning in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [BITS Pilani](bits-pilani.ac.in), and was fortunate to be able to finish my Bachelors thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Sundeep Chepuri](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/) at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru](ece.iisc.ac.in) on the applications of Deep Learning (especially Graph Learning) for 5G and Beyond 5G Wireless Communications. Previously, I have interned at the [Centre for Frontier AI research (CFAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), A*STAR Singapore under Ms. Mengmi Zhang on zero-shot visual search, and worked as a research assistant at the [BITS-IoT Lab](bitsiotlab.com) under [Prof. Vinay Chamola](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vinaychamola/profile) on the applications of Graph Neural Networks for temporally modelling cellular resource allocation.
