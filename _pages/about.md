Hello there! I am a senior undergrad at [BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) where I'm majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am primarily interested in using artificial intelligence to solve problems in signal processing and aspects of geometry in learning and information theory.

I'm currently doing my Bachelors thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Sundeep Chepuri](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/) at the [Dept. of ECE, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru](ece.iisc.ac.in) on applications of Deep Learning (especially Graph Learning) for 5G and Beyond 5G Wireless Communications. Previously, I have interned at the [Centre for Frontier AI research (CFAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), A*STAR Singapore under Ms. Mengmi Zhang on zero-shot visual search, and worked as a research assistant at the [BITS-IoT Lab](bitsiotlab.com) under [Prof. Vinay Chamola](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vinaychamola/profile) on the applications of Graph Neural Networks for cellular resource allocation leading to green communication systems. 

I am broadly interested in the areas of Geometric Deep Learning, Signal Processing and Machine learning/optimization theory.
