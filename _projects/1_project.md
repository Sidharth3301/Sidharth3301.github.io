Implemented a functional path tracing based renderer with features such as area lights, shading normals, alpha masking, thinlens cameras etc. We also created a custom scene render for the Rendering Competition organized by the [Computer Graphics group](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/courses/cg1-2023/index.html). Visit the project [page](https://bakhtiardev.github.io/mystic-hollow/) for some more details.
